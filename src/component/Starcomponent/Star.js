				    	A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma 
				    	held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.  
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent 
				    	the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution,
				    	 and composition of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and 
				    	 evolution of that galaxy. Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture 
				    	 and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and 
				    	 their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary 
				    	 stems that may coalesce about them. Consequently, the study of the birth, life, 
				    	 and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.

				    	Star Formation
				    </h1>  
				    
				    <p>
				      Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. 
				      A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. Turbulence deep 
				      within these clouds gives rise to knots with sufficient mass that the gas and 
				      dust can begin to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. As the cloud 
				      collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it 
				      is this hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a 
				      star. Three-dimensional computer models of star formation predict that the spinning 
				      louds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs; this would 
				      explain why the majority the stars in the Milky Way are paired or in groups of 
				      multiple stars.
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	As the cloud collapses, a dense, hot core forms and begins gathering dust and gas. 
				    	Not all of this material ends up as part of a star — the remaining dust can become 
				    	planets, asteroids, or comets or may remain as dust.				   

				     </p>

				     <p>
				     	In some cases, the cloud may not collapse at a steady pace. In January 2004, an 
				     	amateur astronomer, James McNeil, discovered a small nebula that appeared 
				     	unexpectedly near the nebula Messier 78, in the constellation of Orion. When 
				     	observers around the world pointed their instruments at McNeil's Nebula, they 
				     	found something interesting — its brightness appears to vary. Observations with 
				     	NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory provided a likely explanation: the interaction 
				     	between the young star's magnetic field and the surrounding gas causes episodic 
				     	increases in brightness.
				     </p>
				    
				    <h1 className='f1 lh-title'>Stars And Their Fates</h1>

				    <p>
				    	In general, the larger a star, the shorter its life, although all but the most massive stars live for billions of
				    	 years. When a star has fused all the hydrogen in its core, nuclear reactions 
				    	 cease. Deprived of the energy production needed to support it, the core begins 
				    	 to collapse into itself and becomes much hotter. Hydrogen is still available 
				    	 outside the core, so hydrogen fusion continues in a shell surrounding the core. 
				    	 The increasingly hot core also pushes the outer layers of the star outward, 
				    	 causing them to expand and cool, transforming the star into a red giant.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	If the star is sufficiently massive, the collapsing core may become hot enough 
				    	to support more exotic nuclear reactions that consume helium and produce a 
				    	variety of heavier elements up to iron. However, such reactions offer only a 
				    	temporary reprieve. Gradually, the star's internal nuclear fires become 
				    	increasingly unstable - sometimes burning furiously, other times dying down. 
				    	These variations cause the star to pulsate and throw off its outer layers, 
				    	enshrouding itself in a cocoon of gas and dust. What happens next depends on 
				    	the size of the core.
