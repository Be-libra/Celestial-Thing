			<h5 className='f3 measure fw1 pl3 pr3'>Actually Yes , our sky is kind of a window to universe .We are only 
			  aware of clouds ,glittering points(stars) ,Moon .... </h5>
			<h5 className='f3 measure fw1 pl3 pr3'>But there is lot more stuff that can amaze us 
			in universe.</h5>
			<h1 className='f1 f-headline pa3 i b'>COSMOS</h1>
			<h4 className='f3 fw1 pl4 pr3'>The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. 
			The size and Age of the Cosmos arebeyond ordinary human understanding.Lost somewhere 
			between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective ,
			most human concern seem insignificant.But in the last few thousand years we have made the
			most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the cosmos and our 
			place within it ,explorations that are exhilarating
			I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos iin which we float like a 
			mote of dust in the morning sky. </h4>
			<h4 className='f3 fw1 pl4 pr3'>The dimensions of the Cosmos are so large that using familiar
			units of distance,such as meters or miles,chosen for their utility on Earth , would make little sense.
			 </h4>
			<h4 className='f3 fw1 pl4 pr3'>The surface of the earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean.The Earth is a place .
			It is by no means the only place. it is not even typical place.
			No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the cosmos is mostly empty.</h4>
			<h4 className='f3  pl4 pr3 b'>The only place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum,
			the everlasting space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars and galaxies
			and blackhole seem achingly rare and lovely</h4>
