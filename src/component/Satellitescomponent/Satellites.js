				    	What Is A satellite?

				    </h1>
				    <p>
				    	A satellite is a moon, planet or machine that orbits a planet or star. For 
				    	example, Earth is a satellite because it orbits the sun. Likewise, the moon is a 
				    	satellite because it orbits Earth. Usually, the word "satellite" refers to a 
				    	machine that is launched into space and moves around Earth or another body in 
				    	space.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	Earth and the moon are examples of natural satellites. Thousands of artificial, 
				    	or man-made, satellites orbit Earth. Some take pictures of the planet that help 
				    	meteorologists predict weather and track hurricanes. Some take pictures of other 
				    	planets, the sun, black holes, dark matter or faraway galaxies. These pictures 
				    	help scientists better understand the solar system and universe.
				    </p> 

				    <p>
				    	Still other satellites are used mainly for communications, such as 
				    	beaming TV signals and phone calls around the world. A group of more than 
				    	20 satellites make up the Global Positioning System, or GPS. If you have a 
				    	GPS receiver, these satellites can help figure out your exact location.
				    </p>

				  	<p>
				      In the context of spaceflight, a satellite is an object that has been intentionally 
				      laced into orbit. These objects are called artificial satellites to distinguish 
				      them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon. On 4 October 1957 the Soviet 
				      Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1.

				    	Importance Of Satellites..
				    </h1>

				     <p>
				     	The bird's-eye view that satellites have allows them to see large areas of 
				     	Earth at one time. This ability means satellites can collect more data, more 
				     	quickly, than instruments on the ground.Satellites also can see into space better 
				     	than telescopes at Earth's surface. That's because satellites fly above the 
				     	clouds, dust and molecules in the atmosphere that can block the view from ground 
				     	level.
				     </p>

				    <p>
				    	Before satellites, TV signals didn't go very far. TV signals only travel in 
				    	straight lines. So they would quickly trail off into space instead of following 
				    	Earth's curve. Sometimes mountains or tall buildings would block them. Phone 
				    	calls to faraway places were also a problem. Setting up telephone wires over 
				    	long distances or underwater is difficult and costs a lot.With satellites, 
				    	TV signals and phone calls are sent upward to a satellite. Then, almost 
				    	instantly, the satellite can send them back down to different locations on Earth.
				    </p>

				    	How Do Satellites Orbit Around Earth..
				    </h1>
				    <p>
				    	Most satellites are launched into space on rockets. A satellite orbits Earth 
				    	when its speed is balanced by the pull of Earth's gravity. Without this balance, 
				    	he satellite would fly in a straight line off into space or fall back to Earth. 
				    	Satellites orbit Earth at different heights, different speeds and along different 
				    	paths. The two most common types of orbit are "geostationary" (jee-oh-STAY-shun-
				    	air-ee) and "polar."
				    </p> 

				    <p>
				    	A geostationary satellite travels from west to east over the equator. It moves 
				    	in the same direction and at the same rate Earth is spinning. From Earth, a
				    	 geostationary satellite looks like it is standing still since it is always 
				    	 above the same location.
				    </p>

				  	<p>
				      Polar-orbiting satellites travel in a north-south direction from pole to pole. As 
				      Earth spins underneath, these satellites can scan the entire globe, one strip at 
				      a time.

				    	Why Don't Satellite Crash Into Each Other?..
				    </h1>

				    <p>
				    	Actually, they can. NASA and other U.S. and international organizations keep 
				    	track of satellites in space. Collisions are rare because when a satellite is 
				    	launched, it is placed into an orbit designed to avoid other satellites. But 
				    	orbits can change over time. And the chances of a crash increase as more and 
				    	more satellites are launched into space.
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	In February 2009, two communications satellites - one American and one Russian -
				    	 collided in space. This, however, is believed to be the first time two man-made 
				    	 atellites have collided accidentally.
