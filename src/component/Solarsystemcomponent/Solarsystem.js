				      The Solar System is the gravitationally bound planetary system of the Sun and
				       the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that 
				       orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder 
				       being smaller objects, such as the five dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.
				    </p>
				    
				    <p>
				      The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant 
				      interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with 
				      the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, 
				      Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. 
				      The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials.
				       The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; 
				       he two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances
				        with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as
				         water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly 
				         lat disc called the ecliptic.

				    	The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies 
				    	between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like 
				    	the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the 
				    	Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects 
				    	composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids.
				    	ithin these populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects 
				    	large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity. Such objects are 
				    	categorized as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres 
				    	and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris. In addition to these two regions,
				    	 various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary 
				    	 dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, at least four of the 
				    	 warf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, 
				    	 usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by
				    	  planetary rings of dust and other small objects.				    </p>

				    	The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, 
				    	creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere.
				    	 The heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the 
				    	 posing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to the edge of the 
				    	 scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period 
				    	 comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the 
				    	 heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years 
				    	 from the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
