				    	What Is A Planet?

				    </h1>
				    <p>
				    	This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer. Everyone knows 
				    	that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets. But both Pluto and Ceres were once 
				    	considered planets until new discoveries triggered scientific debate about how 
				    	to best describe themâ€”a vigorous debate that continues to this day. The most 
				    	recent definition of a planet was adopted by the International Astronomical 
				    	Union in 2006. It says a planet must do three things:  
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	1.It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).
				    </p> 

				    <p>
				    	2.It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.
				    </p>

				  	<p>
				      It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar 
				      size near its orbit around the Sun.

				    </p>

				    	The New Definition Of Planet
				    </h1>

				     <p>
				     	Contemporary observations are changing our understanding of planetary systems, 
				     	and it is important that our nomenclature for objects reflect our current 
				     	understanding. This applies, in particular, to the designation "planets". 
				     	The word "planet" originally described "wanderers" that were known only as 
				     	moving lights in the sky. Recent discoveries lead us to create a new definition, 
				     	which we can make using currently available scientific information.
				     </p>

				    <p>
				    	The IAU therefore resolves that planets and other bodies, except satellites, in 
				    	our Solar System be defined into three distinct categories in the following way:
				    </p>

				    <p>
				    	1.A planet is a celestial body that 
				    	(a) is in orbit around the Sun, 
				    	(b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so 
				    	that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and 
				    	(c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.
				    </p> 

				    <p>
				    	2.A "dwarf planet" is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun,
				    	 (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces 
				    	 so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, (c) 
				    	 has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.
				    </p>

				  	<p>
				      All other objects,except satellites, orbiting the Sun shall be referred to 
				      collectively as "Small Solar System Bodies".
